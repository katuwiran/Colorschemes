## Rikai's Colorschemes

This a work in progress repository.

In my glory days, I have set up my colors in different platforms, software. Alas, as fate would have it, my SSD gave out last year, and so I have dragged on recreating most of them from scratch... <sup>But it's fine since I've also changed some of my software preferences...</sup>

In the works:
- [ ] Jetbrains IDEs (Rider, IntelliJ)
- [ ] Logseq
- [ ] niri

That To-Do list you don't actually do:
- [ ] Alacritty
- [ ] Windows Terminal (yes, I dualboot)
- [ ] XResources (colorful vt ftw)
- [ ] Vencord
- [ ] Avalonia
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Kvantum (qt apps)
- [ ] GTK

### Screenshots

WIP. Soon<sup>TM</sup>.

### Colorscheme Utils?

I'm lazy, and I am still iterating over the colors (until now), so I've figured it'd be nice to provide a central "generator" of color scheme configurations across all the platforms I use, so I wouldn't lose my sanity changing a byte of color across a bazillion places.

### Colophon, Special Thanks
For the Catppuccin project, specifically because I have used your implementations, change some code, and then label it as mine lol.

For [Vince](https://github.com/vinceliuice) and his particular tastes in KVantum, GTK. Very great places to start with!

### Some tear-inducing background. <sup>(tears of boredome that is)</sup>

Through the years, I've been iterating over my personal color schemes. First, I fell in love with [Palenight](https://github.com/drewtempelmeyer/palenight.vim). I was green, after all; falling victim to all those editor flame wars. Realizing `vim`/`nvim` isn't really working enough for me (`dein` broke again for the umpteenth time) I switched to `Sublime Text`.

My next phase would be [Catppuccino](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). It's good in the eyes.
